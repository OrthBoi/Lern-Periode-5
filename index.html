      <p>Why did i choose IT to beginn with? Well, first of all my father is a programmer so he played a big role, <br> 
        but i also like to build my own stuff. I like IT because it is logical and straight forward. <br>
      So speaking of that, im a logical person. <br>
      Im a bit creative at times but mostly enjoy clear environments and boundries.</p>
